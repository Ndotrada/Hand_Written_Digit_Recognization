# Hand_Written_Digit_Recognization
A simple python app trained on MNIST data-set and can recognize single digit numbers drawn on the app's canvas

Libraries required:
1. Numpy
2. Matplotlib
3. cv2
4. sklearn

This application recognizes the digit that has been handwritten and gives out the number the user is trying to convey: This has applications in domains such as postal mail sorting, bank check processing, form data entry ,etc. This has been a part of my Code Clause Internship.
