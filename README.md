# Hand_Written_Digit_Recognization
A simple python app trained on MNIST data-set and can recognize single digit numbers drawn on the app's canvas

Libraries required:
1. Numpy
2. Matplotlib
3. cv2
4. sklearn (to fetch MNIST dataset)

Instructions to use:
1) Download the entire package in your system
2) Install the dependencies mentioned above
3) Open digitRecognition_v3 - it would open up the minimalistic GUI which divides the app's canvas into two parts
4) Draw a digit using your mouse on the left part of the canvas. Predictions will be on the right!

This application recognizes the digit that has been handwritten and gives out the number the user is trying to convey: This has applications in domains such as postal mail sorting, bank check processing, form data entry ,etc. This has been a part of my Code Clause Internship.
